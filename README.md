- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheExpertApprentice! My real name is Chris, and while my official designation is an Agile Coach helping provide IT maturity to organizations, I prefer to think of myself as an eternal apprentice on a quest for knowledge. Don't let the title fool you though, as I always consider myself a learner first and foremost.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Agile, process improvement, and software development. I'm especially fascinated by the nitty-gritty of processes, and how tiny tweaks can lead to big changes. Also, I have a soft spot for helping juniors, and teams transition from traditional methodologies to Agile frameworks. In addition to Agile methodologies, my toolkit includes a general understanding of networking, COBIT for IT governance, Linux administration, visual insights, factual strategic planning, and various other frameworks that aid in building resilient, efficient, and effective systems. Most importantly, I endorse and advocate for talent empowerment and mentorship.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about hands-on software development and cybersecurity with the goal of achieving purple team leadership status. I realized that a number of managers, including myself, often lack the hands-on skills that can bridge the gap between management and development teams. To enhance my understanding and contribute more effectively, I am diving into coding, and it's an exciting journey!
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a wide array of projects and initiatives. If you’re working on anything Agile, streamlining processes, or even finding new ways to empower teams, I'm all ears.
Whether you are a seasoned professional or a beginner in the world of Agile, I believe there’s something we can learn from each other. I am also open to collaborating on coding projects, especially if you don’t mind having an ExpertApprentice on board 😊!

  If you’re a developer, let’s talk code!
  
  Whether you’re a seasoned coder or just getting started, I'm keen on learning from and contributing to software development projects. 
  
  Also, for those engaged in cybersecurity, I am on a path to delve into purple team endeavors, and would love to exchange knowledge or work on cybersecurity projects.
  
  Last but not least, if you’re an organization looking to transition to Agile or simply seeking guidance in strategic planning and process improvement, I’d be thrilled to collaborate.
  Essentially, if there's knowledge to be shared, a process to be improved, or a team to be empowered, I'm in!
  
  🤝 Let’s build, learn, and grow together.
